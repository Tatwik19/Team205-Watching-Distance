# Team205-Watching-Distance
Stroke patients can not perceive depth as a result of their stroke. The team hopes to solve this issue by giving stroke patients a wearable device that will tell them how far away objects are.
For stroke patients that have motor skills yet can not perceive depth, this technology would be life-changing. Team 205 talked to an occupational therapist and found out that this is a project that they think would improve the lives of stroke patients in this category.
This device will display distances in meters on a small led panel, as well as a gyro sensor that will only turn on the device when the user holds it up and points it at where they want to measure.
